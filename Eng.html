								<p style="text-align:center; font-size: 20px;"> AI NLP : Natural Language Processing model, Based on the existing text data, words or sentences are predicted within a given TASK.<br>

						<h5> Q&A</h5>
						<details>
							<summary style="cursor:pointer"><U>Please summarize tha VL game.</U></summary>
							<p>1. Anyone can create their own characters and develop their skills as a footballer through PvP / Quest / Scenario.<br>
								2. for PvP, you can recruit characters from other players in the transfer market to form a team. On the contrary, if your character is highly capable and recruited to many gamers, 
								your character can have special ability like fame.<br>
								3. Real-world companies can run clubs in a virtual world called the <strong>League League</strong>. Club owners explore the transfer market and recruit footballer with good abilities.
								Characters who join VL through contracts will be given the privilege of playing in the Virtual League football game.<br>
								4. AI which learned the flow of football game based on real football match logs and online football game's data predicts the scenario of VL's football match between the two clubs.
								And based on this scenario, a football 3D animation will be produced.<br>
								5. The football animation produced above will be revealed and played in the Metaverse space of the time indicated in advance.
								You can directly access the Metaverse environment through a VR device or a general monitor to watch the match. 
								Also you can watch the match through the live-streaming video transmitted from the OTT platform with the broadcast camera angles of football match.<br>
								6. Owners(gamers) of characters who succed in joining the club can have a sense of belonging and show off their characters in a large crowd.

							</p>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary style="cursor:pointer"><U>Why do you think a real-world company will found and operate a virtual club?</U></summary>
							<p>This is because companies can generate real profits by running virtual clubs. 
								If the club recruit good players in the transfer market, maintains a high ranking, and operates the club's SNS, it can be expected to promote corporate brands
								and improve its image by securing fans and supporters.
								In addition, when the club sells existing players to other clubs, it can generate profits from transfer fees, and it can generate profits alone
								in the Metaverse through clothing and main sponsor contracts.
								This is characterized by virtual club, so it is possible to found or takeover the club at a very low proce compared to the real-world club.
								This can be attractive to companies that want to found or takeover sport clubs in real-world but were burdened with huge costs.<br>
								In other words, although it is a virtual sport clubs without substance, it can form a profit structure similar to that of a real-world sport club and generate profits.
								</p>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary style="cursor:pointer"><U>What are some attractive points compared to watching real-life football match?</U></summary>
							<p>You can see flamboyant and dramatic plays and you can see yourself as a pro footballer you imagined.
								I think it is also an attractive point to be able to communicate with people around you, such as family or friends, and watch the football match at home in a Metaverse environment.
							</p>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary style="cursor:pointer"><U>When use VR for a long time, there are side effects issue of motion sickness, so what is the solution to this?</U></summary>
							<p>I have not studied technical solutions. However, there is a way to change the actual football rules a little and apply the new rules.
								For example, the first and second half play times are changed to 20 minutes or it will be changed to a 3 ~ 4 round, not a total 2 rounds.
								In this way, i flexibly thinking about various ways for VR device wearers to get enough rest.
							</p>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary style="cursor:pointer"><U>You said there are additional points for the position when certifying the player's experience, but how do you determine the authenticity of the experience?</U></summary>
							<p>First, it will be determined by a player's life certificate.
								When joining VL club, additional discrimination will be made through confirmation procedures with related agencies.
								If false information is included, i considering cancellation of VL membership and penalty of account.
							</p>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary style="cursor:pointer"><U>How to know the fairness of the results of the two teams predicted by AI?</U></summary>
							<p>By disclosing its own AI NLP model to the owner's company and obtaining consent in advance to predict fairness and game results, it will be certified by the public.
							</p>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary style="cursor:pointer"><U>How can the company that produced and developed this game make money?</U></summary>
							<p>It can earn money from commission-type profits on all profits earned by the owner company within the virtual world 'Virtual League'.
								In addition, you can earn money by 3D assets(signboard of the building, placement of models for vehicles to be released) exposed to the gamer while their moving to the stadium in the metabus to watch the VL game.
								Finally, it can generate profits through stadium billboard advertisements, Tickets for VR/PC Metaverse stadium, streamer's broadcasting rights, etc.<br>
								The most main BM is to "absorb real-world companies into VL Metaverse to revitalize their own economic ecosystem.
							</p>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary style="cursor:pointer"><U>From the gamer's point of view, what is spend money point?</U></summary>
							<p>VL's BM target is not a gamer, but a club owner company that runs a club in VL. 
								VL is characterized by the fact that all players around the world can be registered as players, so there can be a lot of pro footballer that are not limited.
								Therefore, unlike other soccer games, it is not a structure that invalidates the existing season by excessively released season player packs.
								When you form your own team for PvP mode, you don't have to worry about new season pack and spend money for the season pack.
								I will not release paid items that can affect the results of the game.
								For now, The billing element from the gamer's point of view is only a ticket to the Virtual League game (VR/PC).
							</p>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary style="cursor:pointer"><U>What is the expandable content of this game?</U></summary>
							<p>By producing cinematic videos of some players in each club, it can expect to increase consumer's understanding of the VL worldview and give interest.
								Each owner's company can capture the hearts of players who come to watch VL games by producing virtual stadiums (underwater stadiums, etc.) 
								or stadiums with specific regional backgrounds that do not exist in reality. 
								In addition, VL by continent or country can be opened to enter the global market, which can expand the participation of owners in companies 
								and expand the scope of player trade between continents and countries.
								Finally, you can plan mini-games (wave riding, cheering song output, and Metaverse visitors' prizes) when watching metabus games.

							<p>[picture] part of a cinematic video showing the story of a virtual character who dreamed of debuting as a pro footballer in real-life 
								but failed to achieve his dream due to injury and achieved his dream instead in VL.
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary style="cursor:pointer"><U>What square can i see on the main website and in the gallery?</U></summary>
							<p>If you access the Metaverse environment to watch the VL game, you will be spawn to the square located near the stadium.
								You can enjoy a variety of attractions while moving from this square to the stadium.
								If you order through a food store located in the square in the virtual world, you can get a discount, and in real-world, you can watch the VL game, drink beer and eat food that you ordered in VL.
								You will also be able to see the expected release model of a famous car brand placed near the stadium.

						</details>
						<details>
							<summary style="cursor:pointer"><U>What kind of efforts have you made for Virtual League?</U></summary>
							<p>I founded a company and challenged myself to produce it.
								I was involved and supervised in both 3D art and AI R&D in the compan and challenged government support projects and accelerating to attract investment.
								I also produced trailer videos using Unreal Engine 4 and Faceware to introduce items to investors. 
								However, as time went by, I felt limited in manpower and funds, and realized that I lacked the ability to solve this problem myself, so I closed the company.
								Although the company was closed, I had confidence and lingering feelings about the Virtual League, 
								so I vowed to enter a game company that has funds and manpower with my game design document.
							</p>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary style="cursor:pointer"><U>What are some contents related to NFT?</U></summary>
							<p>By applying NFT and blockchain to gamers' characters, i are planning 'Play To Earn' (P2E) content that allows gamers to generate profits when transferring to other clubs after entering VL clubs.
								Although I haven't studied NFT perfectly myself yet, I think VL is a game that has enough potential for P2E content through NFT due to gamers' personal character data and transfer market.
							</p>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary style="cursor:pointer"><U>If you get an offer from a game company, what kind of job do you want?</U></summary>
							<p>If a game company offers to develop Virtual League together, I would like to work as a content designer for Virtual League.
							</p>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary style="cursor:pointer"><U>What are you doing now?</U></summary>
							<p>I am preparing to graduate from university and after closed my company in the summer of 2021, I apply to various game companies with my VL game design document.
							</p>
						</details>
						<details>
							<summary style="cursor:pointer"><U>What would you do if there was no good news?</U></summary>
							<p>I will continue to apply for a game company and if there is a game company that has passed the final round, I will build experience and improve my skills by creating many games there.
								After that, I will propose to the company a VL game with a higher level of completeness.<br>

						<h5> GOAL</h5>
						<p>I want to not only make gamers have fun with the <strong>Virtual League</strong> game i am designing, but also create a new culture in football.<br>
							The new culture i'm talking about is that i can achieve dreams that i haven't achieved in reality in Metaverse and join VL to have a sense of belonging.<br><br>
							In addition, unlike the BM of existing games, I want to succeed in a new BM that it does not generate profits from gamers, but absorbs real-life companies 
							into the virtual world to revitalize the economic ecosystem and generates commission-type profits from the economic ecosystem.<br><br>
							Finally, every weekend, I want to create a new culture where the whole family gathers in the living room to watch Virtual League and drinks beer.<br><br>
							I applied to many game companies while carrying VL game design document and was able to have few times of interviews.<br>
							But they weren't interested in VL at all. They just wanted to put me in their company's game.<br><br>
							I had a chance to work woth game development teams such as FPS and MMORPG, but during interviews, I realized that i didn't just want to create typical games, 
							but i wanted to create a Virtual League game that i designed.
							Therefore, as the last challenge to the world, I created these site.<br><br>
							I'm looking for a company that will shake the world by creating VL with me.<br></p>
